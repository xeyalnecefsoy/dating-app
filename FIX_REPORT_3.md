# Fix Report: Duplicate Accounts Resolved

**Status:** FIXED

I have resolved the issue where two different "Xəyal" accounts were appearing in the search results.

**Action Taken:**
- **Deleted:** The duplicate account "Xəyal Nəcəfov" (Age 19).
- **Kept:** The main Superadmin account "Xəyal" (Age 25).

**Result:**
Search results should now display only **one** entry for "Xəyal" (with the correct profile picture I fixed earlier).

Please refresh the page to verify.
